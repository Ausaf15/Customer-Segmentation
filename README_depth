🛍️ Customer Segmentation using KMeans
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on Customer Segmentation using clustering techniques in Python. The goal is to group customers into distinct segments based on their demographics, income, spending behavior, family size, profession, and tenure. Businesses can leverage these insights for personalized marketing, product targeting, and customer retention strategies.

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains 200 customer records with the following features:

CustomerID – Unique customer identifier

Gender – Male / Female

Age – Customer’s age

Annual_Income_k – Annual income (in thousands)

Spending_Score – Score assigned based on spending behavior

Family_Size – Number of family members

Tenure_yrs – Years associated with the company

Profession – Customer’s profession

⚙️ Project Workflow

Data Preprocessing

Dropped irrelevant columns (CustomerID)

Encoded categorical variables (Gender, Profession)

Standardized numerical features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution plots & correlations

Income vs. Spending behavior analysis

Clustering (KMeans)

Used Elbow Method to determine optimal number of clusters

Applied KMeans clustering to segment customers

Visualization

Scatter plots of clusters (Income vs. Spending)

Cluster profiling based on average values

Insights

Identified 4 unique customer groups with distinct characteristics

Useful for targeted marketing and customer relationship management

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)

Scikit-learn (preprocessing & clustering)

🚀 How to Run

Clone this repo:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-segmentation.git
cd customer-segmentation


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:

jupyter notebook customer_segmentation.ipynb

📈 Sample Output

Elbow Method Plot → helps decide optimal clusters

Cluster Scatter Plot → visualizes customers by Income & Spending

Cluster Summary Table → shows profile of each segment

💡 Future Improvements

Try DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering

Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction

Build an interactive dashboard in Power BI / Tableau
